<code>ray (at) ganardi (dot) xyz</code>

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in Nelly Ng's group.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in University of Warsaw, in Alexander Streltsov's group.
I hold a PhD from University of Gda≈Ñsk, with Tomasz Paterek as my supervisor.

My research is in the field of quantum information theory.
Currently, I am focusing on understanding the laws that govern state transformations.
In my PhD, I focused on the characterization of mediated systems.
In particular, I developed methods to deduce the properties that a mediator must have, by looking only at the correlations between two probes.
In the past, I have worked on various aspects of correlations (negativity as a distance-based measure, definition for multipartite systems, entanglement gain under measurements, etc).
